Marine Sharpshooter 2 No Launcher
=====================

This is a simple program, that is to be used as a replacement for Marine Sharpshooter 2 Launcher.
While the launcher itself isn't broken, it's absolutely useless and it doesn't pass the launch parameters from Steam,
hence the reason for my replacement.

Features
--------
  * Launches the game instantly.
  * Passes launch parameters from Steam to a LithTech.exe, allowing to easily launch the game in Windowed mode etc.

Requirements
------------

  * Marine Sharpshooter 2
  * .NET Framework 4
 
Install
-------
Download the executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/SuiMachine/MarineSharpshooter2_NoLauncher/releases) and use it to replace the original launcher.
Make sure to add an exception in your antivirus (if needed) and check it as trusted. If you're afraid of it doing something to your PC, look at the source-code :)
